## Git Concept Basics

- [ ] Git gets easier once you understand branches are homeomorphic endofunctors mapping submanifolds of a Hilbert space â€“ [Isaac Wolkerstorfer](https://twitter.com/agnoster/status/44636629423497217)
- [ ] (Can be) Distributed
- [ ] Branches are cheap, real cheap
- [ ] Most basic flow is: 
      - Clone (make a local copy)
        - Branch (work on a separate branch of the code)
        - Make changes
        - Add and commit (many times)
        - Merge to some branch (often `master`)
- [ ] The right "flow" will differ from work group to work group, no single holy grail

## GitHub Flow

- [ ] Simple process at use at GitHub
